This example demonstrates a common TypeScript error: 'Object is possibly 'null'. This error is triggered even when a null check is performed if TypeScript's type narrowing isn't explicitly handled. The solution involves using the non-null assertion operator (!) or a type assertion to tell TypeScript that the variable is not null after the check.
